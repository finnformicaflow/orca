# Orca — durable brief for Claude

Read this first. It's the context that isn't obvious from the code.

## The problem Orca exists to solve

An engineer on a fast, high-PR-volume team drives features through a manual chain:
prompt a coding agent → open PR → watch CI/comments → fix conflicts → Slack the reviewers →
bump if it's been a day → merge. Every transition is hand-driven. **Orca automates the
connective tissue between "managing agents" and "managing PRs."**

**Orca launches Claude, Codex, or Cursor headless.** On create, the user selects a provider and Orca runs
`claude -p`, `codex exec`, or `cursor-agent -p` (using the CLI's existing login — no API key) in the new worktree, and shows a
status badge (running/done/error). Headless one-shot is the mechanism for the AUTOMATED board actions
(create, Fix CI, Resolve conflicts, Address review, Follow up, Slack, PR description) — they need the
structured outcome / portable transcript / run ledger, so **board automation is never routed through
tmux**. Alongside it there is now a deliberate **interactive tmux lane** (see below) — a live browser
terminal you drive by hand. Both operate on the SAME worktree, so git stays the source of truth and
they coexist. For a quick jump to a real terminal, "Copy CLI" still gives the provider-native resume
command to jump into an interactive session. When you
switch a card's agent (e.g. one model is maxed out), Copy CLI instead seeds a NEW interactive session
of the pinned provider with the portable transcript (written to a handoff file under the state dir,
never the worktree), so you keep prompting the new model in-context and the previous model is never
resumed. Same-provider follow-ups use the native session id. Cross-provider continuation starts a new native
session seeded with Orca's bounded portable transcript (instructions + final outcomes); files/git in
the shared worktree remain the source of truth. Each worktree is one feature/session, so Orca infers
native resume versus cross-provider handoff from the selected provider instead of exposing a chat-mode toggle.
The git change-summary poll shows commits as they land. Orca
then promotes the branch to a PR and drives it to merge with buttons.

(History: earlier slices deliberately did NOT run agents — the user reversed this. Slack
is an exact copyable message rather than a hidden Claude invocation, preserving provider isolation.
The principle that survives: Orca generates prompts / launches processes but hosts
no chat UI. Browser enrichment persists the small portable turn transcript and active provider/session
pointer; live worktrees, git, provider-native sessions, and GitHub remain the authoritative state.)

## Architecture

- **One Bun process** (`server/index.ts`, via `Bun.serve`) serves the built React SPA *and*
  a plain-JSON API. `Vite` is dev-only (HMR + proxy). The one streaming surface is the interactive
  terminal WebSocket (`/api/terminal/ws`) — everything else is request/response. The listen socket is
  **bound to `127.0.0.1` only** (single-user local tool) so the terminal — which sends keystrokes into
  a live shell — is never network-reachable.
- **Why the process must exist:** a browser can't run `git worktree`, read a local diff, or
  start a dev server. The bridge does *only* what the browser
  physically can't, plus proxies GitHub so tokens never touch the browser. It is not a
  "backend" in the app sense — no DB, no business state.
- **Operational state dir (`~/.orca`, override `ORCA_STATE_DIR`) is the one on-disk exception —
  and it is NOT app state.** It holds run **leases** (`server/lease.ts`: pid/runId/provider/
  branch/expiry, so a restarted bridge rejects overlapping agent runs and reclaims dead/expired
  ones) and the bounded **run ledger** (`server/ledger.ts`: counts/sizes per run for
  `/api/diagnostics` — never prompts, responses, logs, or secrets). Both are **advisory**: if a
  file is missing or unreadable, degrade (reclaim the lease, drop the record) — never refuse a
  legitimate run. Kept OUT of every worktree so they can't leak into a diff or PR body. Leases
  persist across shutdown by design (the bridge leaves agents running; the lease is how the
  restart sees them). Live system + git + gh + localStorage remain the only sources of truth.
- **Source of truth is the LIVE system, not localStorage.** Draft column is driven by
  `GET /api/agents` (git worktrees + in-memory run status); the PR lanes by `GET /api/prs`
  (`gh pr list --author @me`). `localStorage` only **enriches** that live data with what
  git/gh can't recover — prompt, title, provider/session pointer, portable transcript, Slack timestamps — keyed by branch (`web/src/store.ts`).
  PRs/worktrees with no enrichment still render (backwards compat, incl. PRs not made by Orca).
- **GitHub = the `gh` CLI; Slack = a direct `chat.postMessage`** from your identity when a user token
  (`SLACK_MCP_TOKEN`) is set — deterministic, verbatim, instant, no model in the loop (via
  `server/slack-mcp.ts`'s `postMessage`, reused by `/api/slack`). Without a token it falls back to the
  card's pinned agent posting through its own Slack tool (a lightweight model — Claude→Haiku), which
  is non-deterministic (may reword, and can drop under concurrent sends). Both fall back to copying
  the exact message on failure. No OAuth app. The message is the same linked `#7 Title` (Slack mrkdwn
  for the post, rich HTML for the copy).

## Multi-repo (aggregated)

`orca.config.ts` holds `repos: RepoConfig[]` (each with repoPath/worktreeRoot/baseBranch/
previewServices/slackChannel) + global portRange/staleHours. Every repo-scoped API call names
its repo (`?repo=` on GET, `repo` in POST body; server resolves via `repoOf`). The board shows
**all repos aggregated** — the store polls each repo and `useWorkstreams()` builds unified
rows tagged by repo (each row carries `repo`; actions use `row.repo`). Enrichment is keyed
`repo::branch`. The New-draft box has a repo **dropdown**; cards show a repo tag.

## Interactive terminal (the hand-driven lane)

A live browser terminal, backed by **tmux**, for driving an agent by hand — the deliberate exception
to "hosts no chat UI and does not stream". It COEXISTS with headless one-shot (which stays the
mechanism for every automated board action); both share the worktree, git is the source of truth.

- **One tmux session per worktree**, namespaced `orca/<repo>/<branch-slug>` so it can't collide with
  the user's own sessions. Pure naming lives in `shared/tmux.ts` (`sessionName`); the launch-vs-attach
  *command* reuses `attachCommand` (`shared/agent.ts`) — so a terminal resumes EXACTLY like Copy CLI
  (native resume, or a seeded cross-provider handoff file).
- **`server/tmux.ts`** — thin wrappers over the real `tmux` binary (no node-pty / native module, per
  the Bun-only rule): `ensureSession` (idempotent — re-open just re-attaches), `sessionExists`,
  `sendKeys`, `capturePane`, `resize`, `killSession`, `listSessions`. tmux **outlives the bridge** by
  design, so `listSessions` re-surfaces live terminals after a restart (dovetails with `lease.ts`);
  `/api/agents` tags each worktree `tmux: true/false` for the card's live-session badge. If `tmux`
  isn't installed the lane degrades (endpoint 501, no badge) rather than crashing.
- **`server/terminal.ts` + `/api/terminal/ws`** — the WebSocket glue: on connect send the current
  screen (`capture-pane -pe`), then stream raw ANSI via `tmux pipe-pane` → FIFO → `cat` → ws (binary
  frames); client keystrokes → `send-keys -l`, resize → `resize-window`. Reconnects on drop.
- **Frontend:** an xterm.js component (`web/src/components/Terminal.tsx`, all assets bundled — no CDN)
  in a "Terminal" tab of the local/PR detail view.
- **Two entry points:** "Open terminal" (card Agent menu + the Terminal tab, `ensureSession` first so
  it works for a PR/worktree with no session yet); and "Start interactive session" in New-draft (the
  ⌨ toggle) — cuts the worktree, starts the agent in tmux seeded with the typed prompt as its first
  message, and drops you into the terminal. Closing the tab leaves it running.
- **Lifecycle:** killed on Discard/Close (and when a merged branch is reaped); left running on normal
  shutdown — persistence is the whole point.

## The one board & model

One board (`web/src/views/Board.tsx`), lanes: **Local → Draft → In Review → Mergeable → Done·today**.
A workstream is a branch; its lane (`store.laneFor`):
- **open PR, draft** → Draft. **open PR, approved** → Mergeable. **open PR, else** → In Review.
- **no PR** → Local, until Promote (local repo: sets `promoted`; then Mergeable if `git merge-tree`
  is clean, else In Review). **merged today** (server-local calendar day) → Done (`gh pr list --state merged`).

Actions (all via `ActionButton`, spinner → ✓/✗, no double-fire):
- **Promote** (Local, remote repo) = a dropdown: Create PR ready / draft, ± add preview label.
  Local repo → plain Promote (sets `promoted`).
- **Resolve conflicts / Fix CI / Follow up** = launch the selected provider headlessly in the branch's
  worktree. They **`ensureWorktree` first** (`store.ts`): use the existing worktree, else adopt one
  via `git worktree add` from the branch (incl. PRs with no Orca history) — so no action ever
  requires a manual "check out" step or a copied prompt. Follow up resumes the provider-native
session when possible or uses the portable transcript for a cross-provider handoff.
Claude sessions at 80% context or higher also reset through that compact handoff rather than
dragging an almost-full native context into another turn.
  `ensureWorktree` also copies `copyToWorktree` config into the fresh worktree.
- **Mark ready** (draft PR) = `gh pr ready`. **Merge**: PR → `gh pr merge`; local → guarded `git merge`.
- **Discard** never deletes a branch that has an open PR (only pre-PR locals).

Agent runs are killed on discard and on server shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM) so restarts don't orphan
them. Routing: `/` = board, `/{repo}/prs/:n[/files|/checks|/preview]` = PR detail,
`/{repo}/local/:branch[/files|/preview]` = local-session detail.

`web/src/workstream.ts` is the pure state machine (no React/IO — imported by store + tests):

```
DRAFTING → READY → (promote) → IN_REVIEW → (approved) → MERGEABLE → MERGED
```

Lanes are review-driven only (`deriveKanbanState`): approved→MERGEABLE, else IN_REVIEW.
Conflict / CI / mergeability / "ready for review" are **badges, not lanes**. Agent actions use
the workstream's selected provider; Slack posting uses a lightweight model of that provider (or copy). Previews start N services
(frontend+backend) on assigned ports via
`server/preview.ts`.

## Conventions (follow these)

- **Adapter boundary:** all shell/network I/O lives in `server/{git,gh,slack}.ts` behind
  thin functions that take explicit args (no global config reads). Tests swap the `gh`
  binary via a PATH shim and run `git` against a scratch repo — so keep adapters shelling
  out to real binaries, not reimplementing them.
- **Pure logic in `workstream.ts`**, so it's testable without booting anything.
- **Ponytail:** reuse `git`/`gh`, no bespoke machinery. Shortest working change wins.
- **Node is blocked behind an unset asdf** — always run Node-based tools through Bun:
  `bunx --bun tsc`, `bunx --bun vite`. Plain `bunx`/`npm` will fail.

## Committing (do this without being asked)

**Commit and push after every request, no matter how small — don't wait to be told.** The loop
for each task: make the change → **add/update the e2e test that proves it** → `bun run check`
(must be green) → `git commit` → `git push`. One focused commit per request, each with a clear
message. Never leave the working tree dirty at the end of a turn. If on the default branch and the
change warrants a PR, branch first; otherwise commit straight to `main` and push. End commit
messages with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer.

## Run & test

```
bun install
bun run dev      # bridge + Vite (edit orca.config.ts / env first — see README)
bun run check    # tsc --noEmit + bun test — the gate; keep it green on every change
```

`tests/workflow.test.ts` encodes the core problem as W1–W7. **It is the north star: if a
change breaks a W-test, the change is wrong, not the test** (unless the problem itself
changed). See `QA.md` for the manual equivalent against real GitHub/Slack.

**Every new feature or behaviour change ships with a test that exercises it end-to-end** —
a new numbered case in `tests/workflow.test.ts` (or a focused sibling), in the same style: drive
the real adapters (`git` against a scratch repo, `gh` via the PATH shim — see `tests/helpers.ts`),
no network, no mocks of our own code. When you *change* existing behaviour, **update the test that
covered it** so it asserts the new contract, don't just make the old one pass. Push pure decision
logic into `workstream.ts` so most of it is testable without booting anything. A change with a
runtime surface but no test is incomplete; the exceptions are pure docs/comment/style edits.
